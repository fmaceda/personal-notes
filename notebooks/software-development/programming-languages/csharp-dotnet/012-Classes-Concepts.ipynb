    "The C# language is designed so that versioning between base and derived classes in different libraries can evolve and maintain backward compatibility. This means, for example, that the introduction of a new member in a base class with the same name as a member in a derived class is completely supported by C# and does not lead to unexpected behavior. It also means that a class must explicitly state whether a method is intended to override an inherited method, or whether a method is a new method that hides a similarly named inherited method.\n",
