    "SOLID is a set of five design principles that aim to make object-oriented software easier to understand, maintain, and extend. These principles were popularized by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) in his 2000 paper \"Design Principles and Design Patterns\" and the acronym SOLID was coined a few years later.\n",
