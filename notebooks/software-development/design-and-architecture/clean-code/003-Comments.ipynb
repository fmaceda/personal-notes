    "\n",
    "- **Mumbling:** Plopping in a comment just because you feel you should or because the process requires it, is a hack.\n",
    "- **Redundant Comments:** The comment explains the same as you can deduce from function, variables, etc. It probably takes longer to read than the code itself.\n",
    "- **Misleading Comments:** You find misinformation from the comment.\n",
    "- **Mandated Comments:** It is just plain silly to have a rule that says that every variable must have a comment.\n",
    "- **Journal Comments:** Sometimes people add a comment to the start of a module every time they edit it. Something like a changelog.\n",
    "- **Noise Comments:** Sometimes you see comments that are nothing but noise. They restate the obvious and provide no new information.\n",
    "- **Position Markers:** Sometimes programmers like to mark a particular position in a source file.\n",
    "- **Closing Brace Comments:** Sometimes programmers will put special comments on closing braces.\n",
    "- **Attributions and Bylines:** Source code control systems are very good at remembering who added what, when. There is no need to pollute the code with little bylines.\n",
    "- **Commented-Out Code:** Few practices are as odious as commenting-out code. Don’t do this!\n",
    "- **Too Much Information:** Don’t put interesting historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of details into your comments.\n",
    "- **Inobvious Connection:** The connection between a comment and the code it describes should be obvious.\n",
    "- **Function Headers:** Short functions don’t need much description. A well-chosen name for a small function that does one thing is usually better than a comment header."
