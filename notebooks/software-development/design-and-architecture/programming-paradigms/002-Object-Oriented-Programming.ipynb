    "\n",
    "The second paradigm to be adopted was actually discovered two years earlier, in 1966, by **Ole Johan Dahl** and **Kristen Nygaard**. These two programmers noticed that the function call stack frame in the ALGOL language could be moved to a heap, thereby allowing local variables declared by a function to exist long after the function returned. The function became a constructor for a class, the local variables became instance variables, and the nested functions became methods. This led inevitably to the discovery of polymorphism through the disciplined use of function pointers.\n",

    "We can summarize the object-oriented programming paradigm as follows:\n",

    "## Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encapsulation:** Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.\n",
    "* **Inheritance:** Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.\n",
    "* **Polymorphism:** Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.\n",
    "* **Abstraction:** Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given my main language is C#, and it is an object-oriented programming language, I'll be using it for sharing the examples."

    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition \n",
    "Encapsulation is sometimes referred to as the first pillar or principle of object-oriented programming. A class or struct can specify how accessible each of its members is to code outside of the class or struct. Members not intended for consumers outside of the class or assembly are hidden to limit the potential for coding errors or malicious exploits."

Other methods and properties might be only for use in the class or struct itself. It's important to limit the accessibility of your code so that only the intended client code can reach it. You specify how accessible your types and their members are to client code by using the following access modifiers:\n",
